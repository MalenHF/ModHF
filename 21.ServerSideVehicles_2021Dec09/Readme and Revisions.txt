A20 Server Side Vehicles - 9th of December 2021
-----------------------------------------------

==========
BACKGROUND
==========
Modder Snufkin introduced an innovative technique to ornate existing vehicles with attachment models to give them a unique appearance.
In many cases, it went so far as to create new vehicles with experimental features and was released in a pack as Snufkin's Custom Vehicles Mod.
This was followed with a Community version which added more additions on top.

A20 saw numerous updates to the vehicle code, which limits conversion of many A19 vehicles from the previous server side only releases.
However, this A20 release can still combine some of the more popular vehicles from A19. 

Apart from periodic issues with flying stability, and the noticeable lighting from hidden vanilla models on two of the vehicles, this selective few offers a highly functional mix.
The current vehicle list, which is typically restricted by access to vanilla vehicles for their recipes, can be produced on the workbench.
